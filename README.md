# Progressive DevOps Course

A progressive set of demos to learn **DevOps step by step** â€” moving from frontend â†’ backend â†’ database â†’ deployment.  
Each demo introduces one new concept, solves one problem, and creates a new issue to tackle in the next step.  

---

## ðŸ“š Course Philosophy
- Learn by **building small demos** instead of theory dumps.  
- Each step is **simple but incomplete**, motivating the next step.  
- Focus is on **DevOps mindset** (integration, progression), not mastering Flutter or Go.
