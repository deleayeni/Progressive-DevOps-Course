# ☁️ Test 7 — Cloud-Ready Stub (Optional)

## 🧠 Overview

The final step of this series bridges local Kubernetes setups with real cloud environments.  
**Test 7 simulates a production-ready configuration** without requiring an actual cloud deployment.  
It shows what changes when moving from “local dev” to “cloud prod.”

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Learn how cloud deployments differ from local ones.
- Use Helm values to define separate `prod` configurations.
- Switch database connection to an external cloud DB.
- Understand environment-specific overrides and secrets.

## ⚙️ Structure

| Module     | Description                                                                     | Outcome                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **cloud0** | Helm `values.prod.yaml` using external DB secrets and environment placeholders. | Charts render with external DB and no local DB dependency. |

## ⚠️ Problem / Issue

- Local clusters rely on Docker-hosted Postgres.
- Real environments use external managed databases and secrets.
- Configs must support multiple environments (dev, staging, prod).

## 📖 Concepts Introduced

- Environment-based configuration (dev/staging/prod).
- External dependencies (cloud databases, secrets).
- Helm value overrides and parameterization.
- Infrastructure as code for multi-environment pipelines.

## 🔍 Reflection

✅ Application ready for cloud deployment.  
✅ Clear separation between local and production configuration.  
🔜 Beyond this course: integrate **CI/CD pipelines with cloud clusters** for full DevOps automation.
