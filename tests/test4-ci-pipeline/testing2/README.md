# ðŸ§ª Test 4 â€” CI Pipeline: Testing 2 â€” End-to-End (E2E) Testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Learn end-to-end (E2E) testing by testing the complete user journey across all layers of the application.  
Unlike unit and integration tests that test isolated components, E2E tests simulate real user interactions through the full application stack.

## ðŸ“¦ Modules

- E2E test framework setup (Playwright, Cypress, or Flutter Driver)
- Complete user workflow tests
- Browser-based testing against running application
- Visual regression testing (optional)

## ðŸ§  What to Do

1. **Set up E2E testing framework** for your application stack
2. **Write user journey tests** that cover critical workflows
3. **Test complete application** from browser to database
4. **Verify cross-browser compatibility** if applicable
5. **Integrate E2E tests into CI** pipeline

## âœ… What "Done" Looks Like

- âœ… E2E testing framework installed and configured
- âœ… Critical user journeys have E2E test coverage
- âœ… Tests run against full Docker stack (frontend + backend + database)
- âœ… Tests simulate real user interactions
- âœ… CI pipeline runs E2E tests on appropriate triggers
- âœ… Tests can detect UI regression and integration issues

## ðŸ§ª Verification

- E2E tests can launch application in browser
- Tests complete full user workflows successfully
- Tests fail appropriately when functionality breaks
- CI pipeline reports E2E test results
