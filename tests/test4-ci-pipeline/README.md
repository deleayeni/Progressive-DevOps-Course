# ðŸ”„ Test 4 â€” CI Pipeline

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

**Automate builds, tests, and validation** using Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines.  
This test transforms the project from manual testing to automated quality gates that run on every code change.

## ðŸ“¦ Modules

- `ci0/` â€” GitHub Actions workflow setup
- `collab0/` â€” PR templates and branch protection

## ðŸ§  What to Do

1. **CI Pipeline**: Set up GitHub Actions to automatically test and build your application
2. **Collaboration**: Create PR templates and branch protection rules
3. **Quality Gates**: Ensure all code changes are validated before merging
4. **Artifacts**: Build and publish Docker images automatically

## âœ… What "Done" Looks Like

- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow runs on every push and PR
- âœ… Backend and frontend tests run automatically
- âœ… Docker images are built and tested
- âœ… PR template guides code reviews
- âœ… Main branch is protected from broken code
- âœ… Security scanning is integrated

## ðŸ§ª Verification

1. **Check workflow runs:**

   - Go to GitHub Actions tab
   - Verify workflow runs on push/PR
   - All jobs should pass (green checkmarks)

2. **Test PR process:**

   - Create a test branch
   - Make a small change
   - Open a PR
   - Verify template appears and CI runs

3. **Test branch protection:**
   - Try to push directly to main
   - Should be blocked (if protection enabled)

## ðŸ“š Detailed Instructions

For step-by-step guidance, see the tutoring materials:

- **[Test 4 Overview](../../tutoring/05_Test4_CI_Pipeline/_overview.md)** â€” Course introduction and concepts
- **[CI 0 Tutorial](../../tutoring/05_Test4_CI_Pipeline/ci0.md)** â€” Pipeline setup and configuration
- **[Collab 0 Tutorial](../../tutoring/05_Test4_CI_Pipeline/collab0.md)** â€” Collaboration and branch protection

## ðŸš€ Next Step

Once the CI pipeline runs successfully, proceed to **Test 5 â€” Kubernetes Deployment** to deploy your containerized application to a Kubernetes cluster.
