# ðŸ§ª Test 4 â€” CI Pipeline: Testing 3 â€” Acceptance Testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Learn acceptance testing by validating that the application meets business requirements and delivers value to users.  
Unlike technical tests (unit, integration, E2E), acceptance tests verify that the system works as stakeholders expect.

## ðŸ“¦ Modules

- User story and requirement validation
- Behavior-driven development (BDD) tests
- Business logic verification
- Stakeholder acceptance criteria

## ðŸ§  What to Do

1. **Define acceptance criteria** from user stories/requirements
2. **Write BDD tests** using Given-When-Then format
3. **Validate business logic** through automated acceptance tests
4. **Test user-facing features** from stakeholder perspective
5. **Integrate acceptance tests into CI** with appropriate reporting

## âœ… What "Done" Looks Like

- âœ… Acceptance criteria documented for key features
- âœ… BDD tests written for business scenarios
- âœ… Tests validate business requirements, not just technical correctness
- âœ… Tests written in language stakeholders can understand
- âœ… CI pipeline runs acceptance tests and reports results
- âœ… Failed acceptance tests clearly indicate business impact

## ðŸ§ª Verification

- Acceptance tests validate stated requirements
- Tests use business-friendly language (Given-When-Then)
- Stakeholders can understand test results
- CI reports acceptance test status clearly
