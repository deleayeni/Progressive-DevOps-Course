# Demo 0 – Frontend Only

## 🎯 Learning Goal

- Learn how to run Flutter and basic tooling (`flutter doctor`, hot reload).
- Gain confidence by building a simple UI.

## ✅ What You Build

- A basic Flutter counter app (`frontend/`).

## 🧩 Solve

- You have a working UI that increments a counter.

## ⚠️ Issue (what remains unsolved)

- The counter resets to 0 whenever the app restarts.
- No persistence yet → motivates Demo 1.
